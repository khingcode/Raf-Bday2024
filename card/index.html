            <p>Happy 25th Birthday brother, actually old HAHHAHA I hope you enjoy this simple website I coded and this
                greeting. Kabalo ko na namention na nako ni, but I enjoy it pag kita ang bandmates HAHHAH one my fav people
                to be serving with sa exalt, kay I love it when people worship from their heart, and I see that in you
                both on and off stage. Continue to be a dependable kuya to the rest of us, maskin naa ghapon black molds
                and intrusive thoughts (where you lose most of the time btw HAHAHA). I see your heart for the gospel, the lost,
                and even the people closest to you. Evident siya, in your actions and how emotional you can be when it comes to
                these things, you cry a lot during vulnerable and emotional moments, and I admire how you don't hide what you truly feel even when
                you deny it initially. Idk what's your plans after college, but one thing's for sure is God's gotchu. Continue
                to surrender everything to God, and remind yourself that his sovereignty leaves no room for us to doubt his will
                for us. Happy to be close friends with you, happy to be serving in the same ministry with you, happy to be running
                this race with you. Let's continue to persevere!! I'll be praying for your feelings for my sister as well, As much
                as I support and as much as I know you like her a lot, ultimately, It's still God's will and his timing and his decision.
                HAHAHAHA let's goo waiting season!!! nah legit waiting season is so hard bro, Happy din to share this burden with you HAHAHAHA
